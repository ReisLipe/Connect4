# Connect4

A very simple Connect 4 game written in Java. This game was my OOP test, which I developed from around October to December of 2020. Unfortunately, everything was written in Portuguese, which may make things a little challenging for non-speakers, but it's not that difficult to understand. Also, I was never able to build a good GUI for this game, so I would greatly appreciate it if you could contribute to it!

Feel free to use anything you want!

Tabuleiro -> Tabletop;
Partida -> Match;
Pessoa -> Person;
Jogador -> Player;
