# Connect4

A very simple connect4 game writen in Java, this game was my OOP test, wich I made from around October to December of 2020. Unfotunately everything was writen in portuguese, witch  may make a little hard for non speakers, but the things are not that complicated to understend. Also, I was never able to build a good GUI for this game, so I would appreciate a lot if you could contribute with this!

Feel free to use anything you want!

Tabuleiro -> Tabletop;
Partida -> Match;
Pessoa -> Person;
Jogador -> Player;
